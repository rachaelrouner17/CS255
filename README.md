The DriverPass project was created for a client named DriverPass, whose goal was to improve the success rate of students taking their DMV driving tests. The company wanted a cloud-based web system that allows users to take online classes and practice tests, schedule and pay for driving lessons, and track their progress through downloadable reports. Administrators and staff can use the system to manage accounts, monitor activities, and receive DMV regulation updates. I did particularly well in clearly defining the system’s functional and nonfunctional requirements, ensuring that each feature met specific user and business needs. My documentation and diagrams helped create a well-organized and easy-to-follow design that emphasized both security and adaptability. If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the user interface section by adding detailed mockups or examples of how users would interact with the system. This would make the design more user-friendly and visually clear. I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the main problem—low DMV pass rates—and translated those needs into features that help students learn more effectively and make scheduling more efficient. Considering user needs is essential in design because it ensures that the system is practical, intuitive, and effective. When approaching software design, I focus on analyzing user goals, modeling system processes with diagrams, and using an iterative design process that allows for feedback and improvement. In the future, I would continue using strategies like prototyping, modular design, and cloud-based tools to create secure, scalable, and user-centered systems.
